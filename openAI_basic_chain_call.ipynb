Explore your computer\\n\\nManage power\\n\\nUse the information in this section to achieve the best balance between performance and power efficiency.\\n\\nRechargeable battery pack\\n\\nYour computer includes a built-in, rechargeable battery pack that makes mobile computing a reality. When the computer is plugged into an electrical outlet, the battery charges. If you use the computer when you don\\'t have access to an electrical outlet, the battery discharges to supply electricity that the computer system requires for operation.\\n\\nYou can charge the battery any time you want. The battery packs of Lenovo computers support multiple charging modes that are suitable for different power usage habits. You can switch the battery’s active charging mode in Lenovo Vantage, Lenovo PC Manager or Legion Zone.\\n\\nBattery charging is also affected by its temperature. The recommended temperature range for charging the battery is between 10°C (50°F) and 35°C (95°F).\\n\\nNote:\\n\\nYou can check the battery temperature in Lenovo Vantage.\\n\\nTo maximize the life of the battery, once the battery is fully charged, it must discharge to 94% or lower before it will be allowed to recharge again.\\n\\nNormal mode Normal mode is the most basic charging mode. In normal mode, it typically takes 2 to 4 hours for the battery to charge from 0% to 100%.\\n\\nConservation mode If your computer is constantly plugged into an electrical outlet, consider switching the battery charging to conservation mode. In conservation mode, the battery will not be fully charged. Instead, the battery’s charge will be kept within 75%–80%. This is beneficial to the long-term health of the battery.\\n\\nNote: If you want the battery to be fully charged before bringing the computer to work, disable conservation mode by switching the battery charging to normal or rapid charge mode.\\n\\nRapid charge mode If you want the battery to be charged faster than in normal mode, switch the battery charging to rapid charge mode. The following table lists the typical time needed for batteries in rapid charge mode to be charged to 80% and 100% respectively.\\n\\nTable 3. Reference charge time for batteries in rapid charge mode\\n\\nMode\\n\\nTime needed to charge from 0% to 80%\\n\\nTime needed to charge from 0% to 100%\\n\\nRapid charge\\n\\nLess than 1 hour\\n\\nLess than 2 hours\\n\\nNighttime charge optimization Some people follow a regular pattern when using their computers. They finish their workday with the computer at a low battery charge level. They plug in their computers at night and need the battery to be fully\\n\\n© Copyright Lenovo 2023\\n\\n15\\n\\ncharged the next morning so they can unplug the computer and bring it to work. These activities happen at approximately the same time each day. If this sounds like you, consider enabling nighttime charge optimization for the battery.\\n\\nNighttime charge optimization affects battery charging during the night hours, the time when you’re usually asleep. When it is enabled, the computer regularly adapts its charging behavior based on observation of when you plug in the computer at night and unplug it in the morning. During the nighttime, the battery is charged to a particular range and is kept within that range for an extended period, before being further charged to 100%. Nighttime charge optimization ensures safe charging during the night and is beneficial to the long-term health of the battery.\\n\\nNote: With nighttime charge optimization enabled, if you break your routine one day by unplugging the computer much earlier than usual in the morning, you may find that the battery is not fully charged.\\n\\nIf the battery pack of your computer supports nighttime charge optimization, it can be enabled in Lenovo Vantage, Lenovo PC Manager, or Legion Zone.\\n\\nRecover full battery capacity If your computer is constantly plugged in to an electrical outlet and the battery rarely discharges, the battery may not be charged to its full capacity even if the battery meter reports 100% charge. You can recover the battery’s full charging potential simply by discharging and re-charging the battery.\\n\\nStep 1. Unplug the computer and use it until the battery charge drops below 20%.\\n\\nStep 2. Plug in the computer and charge the battery to 100%.\\n\\nUse a power delivery compliant USB Type-C charger with the computer\\n\\nThe USB Type-C connector on the rear side of the computer conforms to the Power Delivery specification. If you did not carry the included ac power adapter with your computer, you have the option of using a qualified USB Type-C charger (purchased separately) that is also Power Delivery compliant to charge the computer in sleep or powered-off state. Lenovo branded USB Type-C chargers with the following listed maximum ratings are tested to work with the computer. Chargers of other brands with the same ratings should also work but are not thoroughly tested.\\n\\n20 V, 4.75 A\\n\\n20 V, 5 A\\n\\n20 V, 6.75 A\\n\\n20 V, 7 A\\n\\nThe rear USB Type-C connector is not designed as the primary power input connector. When the computer is operating, the power supplied by the USB Type-C charger may be insufficient. As a result, the computer may not operate at its full capacity and the battery charging may stop or is very slow. Use the included ac power adapter whenever possible.\\n\\nCAUTION: When purchasing third-party USB Type-C chargers for use with the computer, choose a product that is safety approved or certified. A disqualified charger may cause damage to your computer or pose an electrical hazard. In many countries and regions, manufacturers or importers of electric chargers can submit their products to a certification authority or approved and recognized testing laboratories. Such a product usually carries a mark if it was tested to pass relevant quality and safety standards. For some countries and regions, this certification process is even mandatory. If you live in mainland China, choose a charger with the “CCC” mark; for users in many European countries, choose one with the “CE” mark; for users in the United States and Canada, choose a Listed charger that carries a mark by one of the Nationally Recognized Testing Laboratories. (For example, the “UL Listed”mark). For\\n\\n16\\n\\nUser Guide\\n\\npeople living in other countries and regions, consult a qualified electrical engineer for how to select a safety approved electric charger.\\n\\nSet power button behavior\\n\\nBy default, pressing the power button puts the computer to sleep mode. However, you can change the power button behavior in Windows Control Panel.\\n\\nStep 1. Type Control Panel in the Windows search box and then press Enter. Open the control panel and\\n\\nview by large or small icons.\\n\\nStep 2. Select the power options and then click choose what the power button does.\\n\\nA power plan\\n\\nA power plan is a collection of power-saving settings made available by an operating system. With a power plan, you can set idle time-outs for different hardware components to enter a low-power state. The default power plan and some of its idle time-out settings are listed below for computer models pre-installed with Windows.\\n\\nThe listed settings are active when the computer is connected to an electrical outlet. If your computer include a built-in battery pack, a different collection of time-out settings is set to take effect when the computer is operating on battery power.\\n\\nDefault power plan: Balanced\\n\\nTurn off the display: after 5 minutes\\n\\nPut the computer to sleep: after 15 minutes\\n\\nNote: To wake the computer from the sleep state, press the power button or any key on the keyboard.\\n\\nChange or customize a power plan This operation is applicable to computers with pre-installed Windows.\\n\\nStep 1. Type power plan in the Windows search box and then press Enter.\\n\\nStep 2. Customize a power plan of your preference.\\n\\nAdjustable display refresh rate\\n\\nYour eyes might not notice it but the content displayed on the computer screen refreshes constantly. Display refresh rate refers to the number of times per second the screen content refreshes itself and is measured in hertz (Hz).\\n\\nA refresh rate of 60 Hz is adequate for most situations and is energy efficient. However, when viewing videos or playing video games, a higher refresh rate usually provides a smoother viewing experience.\\n\\nThe displays of some Lenovo computers support dual refresh rates. For such a computer, you can manually switch its display to work at either the higher or lower refresh rate. For Windows operation systems, the manual settings are usually found in Settings ➙ System ➙ Display. As a shortcut, you can also use the key combination Fn + R to switch the display refresh rate.\\n\\nNote: Not all displays support dual refresh rates. If you cannot find settings to change the display refresh rate, the refresh rate of the display might be fixed or cannot be manually changed.\\n\\nChapter 3. Explore your computer\\n\\n17\\n\\nSystem operation modes\\n\\nLenovo has preset several modes in which your computer can operate. The maximum attainable performance, power consumption, and speed limit for the heat sink fan vary between the operation modes. Consider the following conditions when you want to switch operation modes.\\n\\nThe environment where you use your computer\\n\\nThe tasks running on your computer\\n\\nYou switch the operation mode in the pre-installed app Lenovo Vantage, Lenovo PC Manager or Lenovo Legion Zone.
